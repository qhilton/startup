# Recipe Book

[My Notes](notes.md)

A compilation of favorite recipes that you can share with others. Gather your favorite recipes to make your very own recipe book! View others recipes and search the database.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Everybody eats, I don't know anybody that doesn't. And everybody knows that homecooked meals are the best. That's why you can create your very own Recipe Book by digitalizing your favorite recipes! This makes it easy to share recipes with friends, so they too can enjoy! If you are looking for new recipes you can view popular recipes and search for other's favorites.

### Design

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how people would interact with the backend to upload recipes.

```

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to create, edit, and delete recipe cards
- Display of popular recipes
- Ability to search uploaded recipe cards

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages. The login page, home page, create recipe page, and the view recipe page. 
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, recipe display, display other users recipes, searching recipes, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving recipes
    - submitting recipes
- **DB/Login** - Store users, and recipes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't create unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user creates a new recipe, it is broadcasted to all other users.
